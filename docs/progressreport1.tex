Supervisor's Name: Bartek Waclaw

Firm Title for Project: Evolution of metabolic networks



Status: I meet with my supervisor weekly. So far I have conducted tests on the speed of different approaches of modelling graphs in C++, read articles about artificial life and evolution simulation (eg.Court, Steven J., Bartlomiej Waclaw, and Rosalind J. Allen. "Lower glycolysis carries a higher flux than any biochemically possible alternative." arXiv preprint arXiv:1404.2900 (2014).

Currently I'm working on importing the set of chemical reactions and their properties produced by my supervisor's program into my program, and test some simple networks with it.
